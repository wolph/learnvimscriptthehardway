<p>Before we move on to learning more Vimscript, let's find a way to make it easier
to add new mappings to our <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're coding away furiously at a problem and realize a new mapping
would make your editing easier.  You should add it to your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file right
then and there to make sure you don't forget, but you <em>don't</em> want to lose your
concentration.</p>
<p>The idea of this chapter is that you want to make it easier to make it easier to
edit text.</p>
<p>That's not a typo.  Read it again.</p>
<p>The idea of this chapter is that you want to (make it easier to (make it easier
to (edit text))).</p>
<h2 id="editing-mapping">Editing Mapping</h2>
<p>Let's add a mapping that will open your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file in a split so you can
quickly edit it and get back to coding.  Run this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>ev :<span class="k">vsplit</span> $MYVIMRC<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I like to think of this command as "<strong>e</strong>dit my <strong>v</strong>imrc file".</p>
<p><code>$MYVIMRC</code> is a special Vim variable that points to your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.  Don't
worry about that for right now, just trust me that it works.</p>
<p><code>:vsplit</code> opens a new vertical split.  If you'd prefer a horizontal split you
can replace it with <code>:split</code>.</p>
<p>Take a minute and think through that command in your mind.  The goal is: "open
my <code>~/.vimrc</code> file in a new split".  Why does it work?  Why is every single
piece of that mapping necessary?</p>
<p>With that mapping you can open up your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file with three keystrokes.
Once you use it a few times it will burn its way into your muscle memory and
take less than half a second to type.</p>
<p>When you're in the middle of coding and come up with a new mapping that would
save you time it's now trivial to add it to your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="sourcing-mapping">Sourcing Mapping</h2>
<p>Once you've added a mapping to your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file, it doesn't immediately take
effect.  Your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file is only read when you start Vim.  This means you
need to also run the command manually to make it work in the current session,
which is a pain.</p>
<p>Let's add a mapping to make this easier:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">sv</span> :source $MYVIMRC<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I like to think of this command as "<strong>s</strong>ource my <strong>v</strong>imrc file".</p>
<p>The <code>source</code> command tells Vim to take the contents of the given file and
execute it as Vimscript.</p>
<p>Now you can easily add new mappings during the heat of coding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>&lt;leader&gt;ev</code> to open the file.</li>
<li>Add the mapping.</li>
<li>Use <code>:wq&lt;cr&gt;</code> (or <code>ZZ</code>) to write the file and close the split, bringing you
  back to where you were.</li>
<li>Use <code>&lt;leader&gt;sv</code> to source the file and make our changes take effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's eight keystrokes plus whatever it takes to define the mapping.  It's very
little overhead, which reduces the chance of breaking focus.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Add mappings to "edit my <code>~/.vimrc</code>" and "source my <code>~/.vimrc</code>" to your
<code>~/.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<p>Try them out a few times, adding dummy mappings each time.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help myvimrc</code>.</p></div>
