<h1 id="external-commands">External Commands</h1>
<p>Vim follows the UNIX philosophy of "do one thing well".  Instead of trying to
cram all the functionality you could ever want inside the editor itself, the
right way to use Vim is to delegate to external commands when appropriate.</p>
<p>Let's add some interaction with the Potion compiler to our plugin to get our
feet wet with external commands in Vim.</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>First we'll add a command to compile and run the current Potion file.  There are
a number of ways to do this, but we'll simply use an external command for now.</p>
<p>Create a <code>potion/ftplugin/potion/running.vim</code> file in your plugin's repo.  This
is where we'll create the mappings for compiling and running Potion files.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">!</span>exists<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"g:potion_command"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:potion_command <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">"potion"</span>
<span class="k">endif</span>

<span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionCompileAndRunFile<span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">silent</span> <span class="p">!</span>clear
    execute <span class="s2">"!"</span> . <span class="k">g</span>:potion_command . <span class="s2">" "</span> . bufname<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">endfunction</span>

<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>buffer<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>localleader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">r</span> :<span class="k">call</span> PotionCompileAndRunFile<span class="p">()&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first chunk stores the command used to execute Potion in a global variable,
if that variable isn't already set.  We've seen this kind of check before.</p>
<p>This will allow users to override it if <code>potion</code> isn't in their <code>$PATH</code> by
putting a line like <code>let g:potion_command = "/Users/sjl/src/potion/potion"</code> in
their <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<p>The last line adds a buffer-local mapping that calls a function we've defined
above.  Remember that because this file is in the <code>ftdetect/potion</code> directory it
will be run every time a file's <code>filetype</code> is set to <code>potion</code>.</p>
<p>The real functionality is in the <code>PotionCompileAndRunFile()</code> function.  Go ahead
and save this file, open up <code>factorial.pn</code> and press <code>&lt;localleader&gt;r</code> to run the
mapping and see what happens.</p>
<p>If <code>potion</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code>, the file should be run and you should see its
output in your terminal (or at the bottom of the window if you're using a GUI
Vim).  If you get an error about the <code>potion</code> command not being found, you'll
need to set <code>g:potion_command</code> in your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how <code>PotionCompileAndRunFile()</code> function works.</p>
<h2 id="bang">Bang!</h2>
<p>The <code>:!</code> command (pronounced "bang") in Vim runs external commands and displays
their output on the screen.  Try it out by running the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:!</span><span class="k">ls</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Vim should show you the output of the <code>ls</code> command, as well as a "Press ENTER or
type command to continue" prompt.</p>
<p>Vim doesn't pass any input to the command when run this way.  Confirm this by
running:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:!</span><span class="k">cat</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Type a few lines and you'll see that the <code>cat</code> command spits them back out, just
as it normally would if you ran <code>cat</code> outside of Vim.  Use Ctrl-D to finish.</p>
<p>To run an external command without the <code>Press ENTER or type command to continue</code>
prompt, use <code>:silent !</code>.  Run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">silent</span> <span class="p">!</span>echo Hello<span class="p">,</span> world.
</pre></div>


<p>If you run this in a GUI Vim like MacVim or gVim, you won't see the <code>Hello,
world.</code> output of the command.</p>
<p>If you run it in a terminal Vim, your results may vary depending on your
configuration.  You may need to run <code>:redraw!</code> to fix your screen after running
a bare <code>:silent !</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this command is <code>:silent !</code> and not <code>:silent!</code> (see the space?)!
Those are two different commands, and we want the former!  Isn't Vimscript
great?</p>
<p>Let's look back at the <code>PotionCompileAndRun()</code> function:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionCompileAndRunFile<span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">silent</span> <span class="p">!</span>clear
    execute <span class="s2">"!"</span> . <span class="k">g</span>:potion_command . <span class="s2">" "</span> . bufname<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre></div>


<p>First we run a <code>silent !clear</code> command, which should clear the screen without
a <code>Press ENTER...</code> prompt.  This will make sure we only see the output of this
run, which is helpful when you're running the same commands over and over.</p>
<p>The next line uses our old friend <code>execute</code> to build a command dynamically.  The
command it builds will look something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>!potion factorial.pn
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that there's no <code>silent</code> here, so the user will see the output of the
command and will have to press enter to go back to Vim.  This is what we want
for this particular mapping, so we're all set.</p>
<h2 id="displaying-bytecode">Displaying Bytecode</h2>
<p>The Potion compiler has an option that will let you view the bytecode it
generates as it compiles.  This can be handy if you're trying to debug your
program at a very low level.  Try it out by running the following command at
a shell prompt:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>potion -c -V factorial.pn
</pre></div>


<p>You should see a lot of output that looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>-- parsed --
code ...
-- compiled --
; function definition: 0x109d6e9c8 ; 108 bytes
; () 3 registers
.local factorial ; 0
.local print_line ; 1
.local print_factorial ; 2
...
[ 2] move     1 0
[ 3] loadk    0 0   ; string
[ 4] bind     0 1
[ 5] loadpn   2 0   ; nil
[ 6] call     0 2
...
</pre></div>


<p>Let's add a mapping that will let the user view the bytecode generated for the
current Potion file in a Vim split so they can easily navigate and examine it.</p>
<p>First, add the following line to the bottom of <code>ftplugin/potion/running.vim</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>buffer<span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>localleader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">b</span> :<span class="k">call</span> PotionShowBytecode<span class="p">()&lt;</span><span class="k">cr</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nothing special there -- it's just a simple mapping.  Now let's sketch out the
function that will do the work:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionShowBytecode<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c">    " Get the bytecode.</span>

<span class="c">    " Open a new split and set it up.</span>

<span class="c">    " Insert the bytecode.</span>

<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that we've got a little skeleton set up, let's talk about how to make it
happen.</p>
<h2 id="system">system()</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways we could implement this, so I'll choose one that will
come in handy later for you.</p>
<p>Run the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">echom</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"ls"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You should see the output of the <code>ls</code> command at the bottom of your screen.  If
you run <code>:messages</code> you'll see it there too.  The <code>system()</code> Vim function takes
a command string as a parameter and returns the output of that command as
a String.</p>
<p>You can pass a second string as an argument to <code>system()</code>.  Run the following
command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">echom</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"wc -c"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"abcdefg"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Vim will display <code>7</code> (with some padding).  If you pass a second argument like
this, Vim will write it to a temporary file and pipe it into the command on
standard input.  For our purposes we won't need this, but it's good to know.</p>
<p>Back to our function.  Edit <code>PotionShowBytecode()</code> to fill out the first part of
the skeleton like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionShowBytecode<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c">    " Get the bytecode.</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> bytecode <span class="p">=</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">g</span>:potion_command . <span class="s2">" -c -V "</span> . bufname<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%"</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="k">echom</span> bytecode

<span class="c">    " Open a new split and set it up.</span>

<span class="c">    " Insert the bytecode.</span>

<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Go ahead and try it out by saving the file, running <code>:set ft=potion</code> in
<code>factorial.pn</code> to reload it, and using the <code>&lt;localleader&gt;b</code> mapping.  Vim should
display the bytecode at the bottom of the screen.  Once you can see it's working
you can remove the <code>echom</code> line.</p>
<h2 id="scratch-splits">Scratch Splits</h2>
<p>Next we're going to open up a new split window for the user to show the results.
This will let the user view and navigate the bytecode with all the power of Vim,
instead of just reading it once from the screen.</p>
<p>To do this we're going to create a "scratch" split: a split containing a buffer
that's never going to be saved and will be overwritten each time we run the
mapping.  Change the <code>PotionShowBytecode()</code> function to look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionShowBytecode<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c">    " Get the bytecode.</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> bytecode <span class="p">=</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">g</span>:potion_command . <span class="s2">" -c -V "</span> . bufname<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%"</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c">    " Open a new split and set it up.</span>
    <span class="k">vsplit</span> __Potion_Bytecode__
    normal<span class="p">!</span> ggdG
    <span class="k">setlocal</span> <span class="k">filetype</span><span class="p">=</span>potionbytecode
    <span class="k">setlocal</span> <span class="nb">buftype</span><span class="p">=</span>nofile

<span class="c">    " Insert the bytecode.</span>

<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These new command should be pretty easy to follow.</p>
<p><code>vsplit</code> creates a new vertical split for a buffer named <code>__Potion_Bytecode__</code>.
We surround the name with underscores to make it clearer to the user that this
isn't a normal file (it's a buffer just to hold the output).  The underscores
aren't special, they're just a convention.</p>
<p>Next we delete everything in this buffer with <code>normal! ggdG</code>.  The first time
the mapping is run this won't do anything, but subsequent times we'll be reusing
the <code>__Potion_Bytecode__</code> buffer, so this clears it.</p>
<p>Next we prepare the buffer by setting two local settings.  First we set its
filetype to <code>potionbytecode</code>, just to make it clear what it's holding.  We also
change the <code>buftype</code> setting to <code>nofile</code>, which tells Vim that this buffer isn't
related to a file on disk and so it should never try to write it.</p>
<p>All that's left is to dump the bytecode that we saved into the <code>bytecode</code>
variable into this buffer.  Finish off the function by making it look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">function</span><span class="p">!</span> PotionShowBytecode<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c">    " Get the bytecode.</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> bytecode <span class="p">=</span> system<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">g</span>:potion_command . <span class="s2">" -c -V "</span> . bufname<span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"%"</span><span class="p">)</span> . <span class="s2">" 2&gt;&amp;1"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c">    " Open a new split and set it up.</span>
    <span class="k">vsplit</span> __Potion_Bytecode__
    normal<span class="p">!</span> ggdG
    <span class="k">setlocal</span> <span class="k">filetype</span><span class="p">=</span>potionbytecode
    <span class="k">setlocal</span> <span class="nb">buftype</span><span class="p">=</span>nofile

<span class="c">    " Insert the bytecode.</span>
    <span class="k">call</span> append<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> split<span class="p">(</span>bytecode<span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'\v\n'</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>append()</code> Vim function takes two arguments: a line number to append after,
and a list of Strings to append as lines.  For example, try running the
following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">:</span><span class="k">call</span> append<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> [<span class="s2">"foo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"bar"</span>]<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This will append two lines, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, below line 3 in your current
buffer.  In this case we're appending below line 0, which means "at the top of
the file".</p>
<p>We need a list of Strings to append, but we just have a single string with
newline characters embedded in it from when we used <code>system()</code>.  We use Vim's
<code>split()</code> function to split that giant hunk of text into a list of Strings.
<code>split()</code> takes a String to split and a regular expression to find the split
points.  It's pretty simple.</p>
<p>Now that the function is complete, go ahead and try out the mapping.  When you
run <code>&lt;localleader&gt;b</code> in the <code>factorial.pn</code> buffer Vim will open a new buffer
containing the Potion bytecode.  Play around with it by changing the source,
saving the file, and running the mapping again to see the bytecode change.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Read <code>:help bufname</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help buftype</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help append()</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help split()</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help :!</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help :read</code> and <code>:help :read!</code> (we didn't cover these commands, but
they're extremely useful).</p>
<p>Read <code>:help system()</code>.</p>
<p>Read <code>:help design-not</code>.</p>
<p>Currently our mappings require that the user save the file themselves before
running the mapping in order for their changes to take effect.  Undo is cheap
these days, so edit the functions we wrote to save the current file for them.</p>
<p>What happens when you run the bytecode mapping on a Potion file with a syntax
error?  Why does that happen?</p>
<p>Change the <code>PotionShowBytecode()</code> function to detect when the Potion compiler
returns an error, and show an error message to the user.</p>
<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>
<p>Each time you run the bytecode mapping a new vertical split will be created,
even if the user hasn't closed the previous one.  If the user doesn't bother
closing them they could end up with many extra windows stacked up.</p>
<p>Change <code>PotionShowBytecode()</code> to detect with a window is already open for the
<code>__Potion_Bytecode__</code> buffer, and when that's the case switch to it instead of
creating a new split.</p>
<p>You'll probably want to read <code>:help bufwinnr()</code> for this one.</p>
<h2 id="more-extra-credit">More Extra Credit</h2>
<p>Remember how we set the <code>filetype</code> of the temporary buffer to <code>potionbytecode</code>?
Create a <code>syntax/potionbytecode.vim</code> file and define syntax highlighting for
Potion bytecode buffers to make them easier to read.</p></div>
